# Welcome to the config file, here you can adjust the general settings of the plugin.
# the lines must be in YAML format, so it doesn't accept tabs, only spaces.
# And you need to make sure you have "escaped" all apostrophes in your text: If you want to write "don't", for example, write "don''t" instead (note the doubled apostrophe).

# Select the plugin language (Config will always be in english), you can select one of following languages: "en_US", "fr_FR", "es_ES", "nl_NL", "de_DE", "zh_TW", "tr_TR" and "ru_RU").
